# C-file-copy-program
This is a C program that copies the contents of one file to another much like the cp command linux.
The source and target files and blocksize are put in as command line arguements which makes the program highly flexible
The first file which is argv[1] must already be made in order for the program to work however the program will automatically generate the second file.
